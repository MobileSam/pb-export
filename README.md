# pb-export

> PasswordBox export tool.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `pb-export` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
npm install -g pb-export
```

**Note:** The job of the `pb-export` command is to export your passwords from PasswordBox to a CSV file containing the following columns `name`, `url`, `login`, `password`.  The `password.csv` file will be generated in the current directory. This command connects directly to PasswordBox's servers.
